      <h2>Generative music</h2>
        <div id="project1" placeholder="photo1">
          <h3>Linguistic</h3>
            <p>Music composed from analytic theories that are so explicit as to be able to generate structurally coherent material (Loy and Abbott 1985; Cope 1991). This perspective has its roots in the generative grammars of language (Chomsky 1956) and music (Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983), which generate material with a recursive tree structure.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="project2" placeholder="photo2">
          <h3>Interactive</h3>
            <p>Music generated by a system component that has no discernible musical inputs. That is, "not transformational" (Rowe 1991; Lippe 1997:34; Winkler 1998). The Koan software by SSEYO – used by Brian Eno to create Generative Music 1 – is an example of this.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="project3" placeholder="photo3">
          <h3>Creative</h3>
            <p>Music generated by processes that are designed and/or initiated by the composer. Steve Reich's It's Gonna Rain and Terry Riley's In C are examples of this (Eno 1996).</p>
